## solving a codewar problem that checks to see if numbers in an array are square
### Prompt: 
Write a function that checks whether all elements in an array are square numbers. The function should be able to take any number of array elements.

Your function should return true if all elements in the array are square numbers and false if not.

An empty array should return undefined. You can assume that all array elements will be positive integers.
### Although, I was unable to correctly solve this. I am still uploading, so I could return and get a correct answer. However, here what I was trying to do:
loop through an array, check if each number was a square by checking to see if it was divisible my it's square root
if yes, it will return true, if no it will retun false, if there is nothing in the array, it will return undefined
